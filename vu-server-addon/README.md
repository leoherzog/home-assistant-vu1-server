# VU-Server Home Assistant Add-On

This Home Assistant add-on runs the [`VU-Server`](https://github.com/SasaKaranovic/vu-server) server software to control Streacom [VU1 Dynamic Analogue Dials](https://vudials.com/). VU1 Dials are physical, USB-connected VU meters with eInk screens that can be controlled via API calls. This add-on provides the VU-Server API within your Home Assistant environment, but does not include a custom component for Home Assistant entities.
